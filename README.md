## Disclaimers

:pushpin: This project is a work in progress. There are still a lot of features waiting to be implemented, and the game is far from being completed. 

:pushpin: Miner.js is not associated with Mojang or Minecraft in any sort of official capacity.

# Motivation

We thought it would be interesting to design a game that is inpsired by the hugely popular game "Minecraft" with javascript. We are interested to see if javascript can deliver quality graphics and performance, and interactive multiplayer gameplay within a 3D voxel type environment.

# Screenshots

These are some screenshots taken directly from the project.
