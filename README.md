### Disclaimer

:pushpin: This project is a work in progress. There's still a lot of features waiting to be implemented, and the game is far from being the actual game.

### **MC.JS brings the best-selling PC game Minecraft into the web with the power of Javascript.**

# Motivation

Having to open an additional app to play a game is sometimes too tiring. Therefore, I thought it'd be interesting to somehow implement Minecraft with javascript, essentially bringing the whole Minecraft game onto the web. This not only takes away the tedious process of installing the game, it also brings the entire game to players within a couple clicks.
